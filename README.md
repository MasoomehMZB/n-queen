# N-Queens Solver

This project provides a graphical interface to solve the **N-Queens problem** using two algorithms: **Backtracking** and **Genetic Algorithm**. The application is built with **Python** and **Tkinter*

## Features

-  **Backtracking Algorithm**: Visualizes the step-by-step placement of queens.
-  **Genetic Algorithm**: Finds solutions using evolutionary strategies.
-  **Tkinter GUI**: User-friendly interface to select board size and algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.12+** installed.

2. Install Tkinter if not already available.

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. In the GUI:

   * Enter the board size (`N`)
   * Select the algorithm
   * Click "Solve"
